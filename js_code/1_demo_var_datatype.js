/*1. Variables and Data Types
Problem 1: Create a simple user profile
Create variables for storing user data (e.g., name, age, and email) and log them to the console.

Steps:

Create a variable for name, age, and email.
Use console.log() to display the values in the console.
Why this helps React: React components often use variables to store and render user data (like name, age, etc.).*/

let name = "Anand";
let age = 35;
let email = "anand@example.com";

console.log(name, age, email);
